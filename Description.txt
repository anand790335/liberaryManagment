Description for the code

Description:

This C++ code represents a simple library management system with three main classes: `Book`, `MemberRecord`, and `Librarian`. The program simulates book issuance by a librarian to a member (in this case, a student). Each `Book` object has a title and availability status, initially set to true. The `MemberRecord` class stores information about a library member, including their name and the number of books they have issued.

The `Librarian` class is responsible for validating a member, registering new members, and issuing books. It checks if a member is valid (based on a simple book quota check), registers new members if necessary, and issues books if all conditions are met. If a book is successfully issued, its availability status is set to false, and the member's book count is incremented.

The `Student` class represents a library user who can inquire about a book through the `inquireAboutBook` method, which involves interacting with the librarian to check availability and issue the book.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of `Book`, `MemberRecord`, `Librarian`, and `Student`. It then initiates an inquiry about a sample book through the student, interacting with the librarian's book issuance process. The program outputs messages indicating the success or failure of the book issuance based on the specified conditions.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for a library system, showcasing the interactions between books, members, librarians, and students.
